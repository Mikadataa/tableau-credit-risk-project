# 🔄 Tableau Project Process — Credit Risk & Collections Strategy

This project follows a structured 4-step process.
Each step ensures clarity, consistency, and professional delivery.

---

## 📌 Step 1 — Analyse Requirements
- Collect requirements (business + data)
- Define **KPIs** (default rate, delinquency stages, repayment %, success rate, repayment ratio)
- Choose right charts for each requirement
- Draw dashboard mockups
- Choose color scheme

---

## 📌 Step 2 — Build Data Source
- Connect dataset (Kaggle: Default of Credit Card Clients)
- Transformations: clean the data, rename fields & tables for clarity
- Create data model (derive fields: delinquency stage, repayment ratio, A/B group)
- Check data types in tableau (numeric vs categorical)
- Understand and document data limitations

---

## 📌 Step 3 — Build Charts
- KPIs (BANS) → Total clients, Default %, Avg. repayment ratio, Avg. credit limit
- Trend chart → Delinquency over 6 months
- Funnel chart → Roll rates (Current → Early → Mid → Late)
- Bar charts → Default by demographics (Gender, Age, Education, Marriage)
- A/B test line chart → Repayment success Control vs Test

---

## 📌 Step 4 — Build Dashboards
- Create container structure (Executive, Strategy, Customer dashboards)
- Place all charts into logical sections
- Apply formatting:
  - Distribute objects evenly
  - Format colors & sizes
  - Fit “Entire View”
  - Add legends and padding
- Add interactivity:
  - Filters (Age group, Education, Limit bands)
  - Drill-down options (possible extension)
- Add icons for demographics and KPIs
- Final polish: Consistent titles, tooltips, and branding
